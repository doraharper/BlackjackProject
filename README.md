#Lessons Learned

I had a rough start getting to a point where I could make sense of what went where then how to properly call the methods and get objects to interact with each other and work properly. I first wrote everything out, most of it was scattered in clusters of logic here and there. This project helped me see how it all works together and I had a lot of moments where I could see the light bulb going off, which was nice to see that the process is working!!
